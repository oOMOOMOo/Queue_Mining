  abstract = {The paper presents a universal and comprehensive synthesis technique
	of coupled resonator filters with source/load-multiresonator coupling.
	The approach is based on repeated analyses of a circuit with the
	desired topology; no similarity transformation is needed. Restrictions
	imposed by the implementation on the coupling coefficients such as
	signs and orders of magnitudes are straightforwardly handled within
	this technique. The technique is then used to synthesize and design
	filters with full or almost full coupling matrices by selecting,
	among the infinite number of solutions, the matrix that corresponds
	to the actual implementation. In such cases, analytical techniques
	and those based on similarity transformations cannot be used since
	they provide no mechanism to constrain individual coupling coefficients
	in order to discriminate between two full coupling matrices, which
	are both solutions to the synthesis problem. Using the technique
	described in this paper, a filter designer can extract the coupling
	matrix of a filter of arbitrary order and topology while enforcing
	relevant constraints. There is no need to master all the different
	existing similarity-transformation-based techniques and the topologies
	to which they are applicable. For the first time, detailed investigations
	of parasitic coupling effects, for either compensation or utilization,
	are made possible. The method is applied to the synthesis of a variety
	of filters, some of which are then designed and built and their response
	measured.},

  abstract = {A method for realization of dual-mode coupling in rectangular waveguide
	cavities is described and analyzed. The method completely replaces
	the coupling screw, and therefore can be used to eliminate the need

	a wide range of coupling values and can achieve higher power-handling
	capability than coupling screws. Mode matching is used to calculate
	the mode chart of the infinitely long square corner cut rectangular
	waveguide (SCCRW), the field distributions of each mode, and the
	resonant frequencies of the cavity. An evanescent mode rectangular
	waveguide is used to provide dual-mode couplings between adjacent
	cavities. The junction discontinuity between the SCCRW and the rectangular
	waveguide is modeled by a double mode-matching method, yielding modal
	scattering parameters of the junction. A four-pole dual-mode elliptic-function
	rectangular waveguide cavity filter using the coupling method was

  abstract = {An improvement to a recently reported theory for the analysis of the
	pattern and impedance loci of microstrip antennas is developed. It
	yields a theory which is simple and inexpensive to apply. The fields
	in the interior of the antennas are characterized in terms of a discrete
	set of modes. The poles corresponding to these modes are complex
	and depend on the losses in the antenna. The representation of the
	fields in terms of these modes is rigorous only for a bona fide cavity
	with no copper loss. The proper shift in the complex poles due to
	the addition of copper and radiative losses is approximated by lumping
	the latter two together with the dielectric loss to form an effective
	loss tangent. By so doing, it is found that the resulting expressions
	for impedance of the microstrip antenna are in good agreement with
	measured results for all modes and feed locations. The theory is
	applied to the evaluation of impedance variation with feed location,
	to multiport analysis, and to the design of circularly polarized
	microstrip antennas.},
